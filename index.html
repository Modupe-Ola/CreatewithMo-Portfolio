My name is Modupeola, Mo' you can call me.</p> 

<p>I am a Frontned developer and Tech recruiter, who lives in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>

<p><em>Mo'</em>, as now fondly called, pivoted into tech after having over 6 years of work expriences from the roles of Marketing, Customer Service and Human Resource, which ranges from the financial industry, cryptocurrency, health-tech, biometrics, fintech and Saas.</p>

<p>My love for problem solving and customer centrism propelled me to learn tech-skills and a focus in frontend development. This choice was owing to years of experience in financial industry and customer service role, where I was faced with a lot of customers' issue with non-fucntionality of the Apps and website profile pages. This inqusiitive act led to be birth of now being a front end developer.</p>

<p>This is my portfolio page, feel free to look around, I am sure you will like what you see.</p>
<p>You want to get in touch? <em>Holla me here...</em></p>
